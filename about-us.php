            As the pandemic emerges globally, the team acknowledges the difficulty of going to the
            mall and buying things that consumers want. The team completed this project because they
            believed that as the internet grows in popularity, it should be used wisely by creating
            an electronic shop on a website that allows consumers to stay safe during pandemics and
            save time shopping. Online shopping is a type of electronic commerce that allows users
            to order items they require simply by using their mobile or web browser.

          <p class="mt-4 leading-prose text-slate-500">
            Our website is a fast-growing e-commerce shop that helps consumers save their precious
            time and stay safe. The electronic shop was made with only one goal: to give happiness
            to the consumer or buyer and help them give love and care to others by giving gifts.
